      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Last updated: <time id="lastUpdated">2026-01-05</time></p>
      <p>This policy describes how we treat information in the “Catholic Inspiration” mobile app and this website. While our priority is your spiritual privacy, we use necessary technical services to keep the app free and sustainable.</p>

      <h2>Data Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No Account Creation:</strong> We do not ask for your name, email, or phone number to use the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Your favorites and settings are saved locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Services:</strong> We use Google AdMob (ads), Firebase (analytics), and Google Play (donations). These services may collect anonymous device identifiers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data We Process & Third Parties</h2>

      <h3>1. Advertising (AdMob)</h3>
      <p>The free version of the app shows ads managed by Google AdMob. Google may use your device's advertising ID and cookies to personalize ads.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the European Economic Area (EEA), we will ask for your explicit consent via a form (CMP) before showing personalized ads.</li>
        <li>You can learn how Google uses this data here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Google uses information</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Analytics & Stability (Firebase)</h3>
      <p>We use Google Analytics for Firebase and Crashlytics to understand how the app is used (e.g., popular screens) and to detect errors (crashes). This data is anonymous and aggregated.</p>

      <h3>3. Donations & Payments</h3>
      <p>If you choose to make a voluntary donation, the transaction is processed entirely through <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We <strong>do not</strong> have access to your financial data (credit card, bank account).</li>
        <li>Google Play only notifies us that the transaction has been completed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. On this Website</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>This website <strong>does not use tracking cookies</strong> or third-party analytics. We only use your browser's Local Storage to remember your language preference (English or Spanish) if you choose to change it manually.</p>
      </ul>

      <h2>Legal Basis (GDPR/EEA)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For ad personalization and analytics (requested upon launching the app/site).</li>
        <li><strong>Contract Performance:</strong> To process voluntary donations initiated by you.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> To display non-personalized (contextual) ads necessary to support the free service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>You can revoke your consent for personalized ads at any time via the app settings or Android system settings. You may also request access to or deletion of data associated with your advertising ID, although since we do not have user accounts, resetting your advertising ID or uninstalling the app is usually sufficient.</p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>The app is intended for users over 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
